# Privalia Code Challenge 2018
This repository contains the code used to participate in the Privalia Code Challenge that took place in 2018.

### How does it work
This code does not do nothing by itself. It consists in an API REST that is expecting an input JSON that is to be received from the game engine that is publicly available here: https://github.com/PrivaliaTech/code-challenge-2018

To be able to run this script you should set-up the engine following the instructions provided in the above link.
